# SimpleGistCreator

DEMO: https://abdulhannanali.github.io/SimpleGistCreator/

SimpleGistCreator is an HTML5 Based Web Application which uses store.js to store data on the client's computer which is one of it's most important functionality. 

SimpleGistCreator uses Github's gist api in order to create the gists. Meanwhile, it can only create anonymous gists with a single file but I might extend it in the future. This application uses browserify for the code managment.

### Libraries
Following are the libraries I used for this application

- store (best localStorage wrapper)
- jQuery (for basic DOM manipulation and AJAX requests)
- jsRender (for templating)
